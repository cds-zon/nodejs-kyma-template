# Developer Agent Task Definition

## Task Goals
Create a comprehensive developer agent in Mastra that can:
1. Work with GitHub repositories from configuration
2. Pull repositories and run them in containers
3. Push changes and create pull requests
4. Manage development tasks
5. Use MCP servers to provide enhanced tooling capabilities

## Requirements
- **GitHub Integration**: Configure GitHub API access with hardcoded repository support initially
- **Container Management**: Ability to run repositories in containerized environments
- **Git Operations**: Pull, push, branch management, and PR creation
- **Task Management**: Track and manage development tasks
- **MCP Integration**: Use MCP servers for additional tool provisioning
- **Learning Capabilities**: Use Mastra tools to learn about Mastra itself

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Developer agent created and configured in Mastra
- [ ] GitHub integration working with repository operations
- [ ] Container execution capability implemented
- [ ] Git workflow automation (pull, push, PR creation)
- [ ] Task management system integrated
- [ ] MCP servers configured and providing tools
- [ ] Agent can learn about Mastra using its own tools
- [ ] All functionality tested and working

## Technical Specifications
- Use `@mastra/github` for GitHub integration
- Use `@mastra/mcp` for MCP server integration
- Implement secure credential management
- Follow Mastra best practices for agent development
- Use Zod schemas for input/output validation

## Initial Configuration
- Start with hardcoded GitHub repository configuration
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Implement basic containerization with Docker
