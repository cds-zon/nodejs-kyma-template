# Memory Bank - Documentation Repository

This folder serves as a **chronological documentation repository** for the Mastra + CDS integration project, preserving the actual development journey and learning process.

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use This Memory Bank

### For Logging New Documentation

When creating new documentation files in this folder:

1. **Check the latest number**: Look at existing files to find the highest number
2. **Use chronological naming**: `XX_DESCRIPTIVE-NAME.md` (e.g., `09_NEW-FEATURE.md`)
3. **Be descriptive**: Use clear, specific names that reflect the actual content
4. **Preserve timeline**: Don't reorganize - maintain the creation order for historical context

**Example naming pattern:**
```
09_NEW-AUTHENTICATION-METHOD.md
10_API-INTEGRATION-ISSUES.md
11_DEPLOYMENT-OPTIMIZATION.md
```

### For Reading Documentation

The files are organized **chronologically by creation date**, not by logical workflow:

- **Lower numbers** = Earlier in development timeline
- **Higher numbers** = More recent developments
- **Read sequentially** to understand the evolution of solutions

## ðŸ“š Current Documentation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Connectivity (Sep 24-25)
- `01_APPROUTER-OAUTH-PROXY.md` - OAuth proxy configuration
- `02_TROUBLESHOOTING-MASTRA-AI-CONNECTIVITY.md` - Early connectivity issues
- `03_MASTRA-AI-CONNECTIVITY-ISSUE.md` - Detailed issue analysis
- `04_MASTRA-CONNECTIVITY-TEMP-SOLUTION.md` - Temporary connectivity fixes

### Phase 2: Authentication Development (Sep 28)
- `05_IAS-AUTH-MASTRA.md` - IAS authentication integration
- `06_CDS-AUTH.md` - CDS authentication setup
- `07_CDS-INTEGRATION.md` - Complete CDS integration guide
- `08_DIRECT-CDS-AUTH.md` - Direct authentication approach

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Benefits

### Why Chronological Order?
- **Preserves learning journey** - See how solutions evolved
- **Maintains context** - Understand why certain decisions were made
- **Enables revisiting** - Trace back through the actual development process
- **Documents failures** - Keep track of what didn't work and why

### When to Create New Files
- **New feature implementation**
- **Problem discovery and resolution**
- **Integration attempts (successful or failed)**
- **Configuration changes**
- **Troubleshooting sessions**

## ðŸ“– Reading Guidelines

1. **Start with lower numbers** for historical context
2. **Look for patterns** across related files (e.g., connectivity issues in 02-04)
3. **Note timestamps** in file content for precise timing
4. **Cross-reference** related files mentioned in documentation

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance Rules

- **Never reorganize** existing numbered files
- **Don't rename** files to change their chronological position
- **Add new files** with the next sequential number
- **Update this README** when adding new phases or significant milestones

*This memory bank preserves the real story of development - the successes, failures, and evolution of solutions. Each file represents a moment in time and learning.*
