# SAP App Router with IAS Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented SAP App Router with IAS (Identity Authentication Service) authentication using CDS CLI and deployed to Kyma cluster.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Project Setup
- ‚úÖ Created new branch `feature/approuter-ias-integration` from `feature/move-deployment-to-helm`
- ‚úÖ Initialized CDS project with sample data using `cds init --add sample`
- ‚úÖ Added App Router using `cds add approuter`
- ‚úÖ Added Helm charts using `cds add helm`
- ‚úÖ Added containerization using `cds add containerize`

### 2. IAS Configuration
- ‚úÖ Created IAS Service Instance with proper OAuth2 configuration:
  - Application name: `approuter-demo`
  - Display name: `approuter-demo-ias`
  - Home URL: `https://approuter-demo-test.c-127c9ef.stage.kyma.ondemand.com`
  - User access: `public`
  - OAuth2 grant types: `authorization_code`, `authorization_code_pkce_s256`
  - Public client: `true`
  - Redirect URIs configured for App Router callback
  - Subject name identifier: `mail` with fallback `none`
  - Assertion attributes configured for user data

- ‚úÖ Created IAS Service Binding:
  - Service instance: `approuter-demo-ias`
  - Secret name: `approuter-demo-ias-binding-secret`
  - Credential type: `NONE`

### 3. App Router Configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `xs-app.json` to use IAS authentication:
  ```json
  {
    "authenticationMethod": "route",
    "routes": [
      {
        "source": "^/(.*)$",
        "target": "$1",
        "destination": "srv-api",
        "csrfProtection": true,
        "authenticationType": "ias"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 4. Container Images
- ‚úÖ Built and pushed container images for both service and App Router:
  - Service: `scai-dev.common.repositories.cloud.sap/approuter-demo-srv:latest`
  - App Router: `scai-dev.common.repositories.cloud.sap/approuter-demo-approuter:latest`
- ‚úÖ Images built for correct platform (`linux/amd64`) to work with Kyma cluster

### 5. Kyma Deployment
- ‚úÖ Deployed to namespace `approuter-demo-test`
- ‚úÖ Created image pull secret for private registry access
- ‚úÖ IAS Service Instance: `Created` and `Ready`
- ‚úÖ IAS Service Binding: `Created` and `Ready`
- ‚úÖ IAS Secret: `approuter-demo-ias-binding-secret` created with 15 keys
- ‚úÖ APIRules: Both service and App Router APIRules are `Ready`

### 6. APIRule Configuration
- ‚úÖ App Router APIRule configured with JWT authentication:
  - JWKS URL: `https://afcdpcyaf.accounts400.ondemand.com/oauth2/certs`
  - Trusted issuer: `https://afcdpcyaf.accounts400.ondemand.com`
  - Gateway: `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- IAS Service Instance and Binding are ready
- APIRules are deployed and ready
- Container images are built and pushed
- Image pull secrets are configured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues
- Pods experiencing `CreateContainerConfigError` - likely related to App Router configuration
- Some pods pending due to cluster resource constraints

### üîó Access URLs
- App Router: `https://approuter-demo-test.c-127c9ef.stage.kyma.ondemand.com`
- Service: `https://approuter-demo-srv-approuter-demo-test.c-127c9ef.stage.kyma.ondemand.com`

## Next Steps
1. Resolve the `CreateContainerConfigError` by checking App Router configuration
2. Verify IAS authentication flow is working
3. Test the complete authentication flow end-to-end
4. Apply the same pattern to the main agent services (mastra, chat, assistant-ui)

## Key Learnings
1. CDS CLI provides excellent scaffolding for SAP App Router with IAS integration
2. Proper platform-specific image building is crucial for Kyma deployment
3. IAS service binding provides seamless integration with App Router
4. APIRule v2 with JWT authentication works well with IAS
