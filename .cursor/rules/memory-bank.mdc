# Memory Bank & Task Management Rules

## For Each New Task:

### 1. Branch Management
- Create a dedicated branch for the task using format: `task-[task-name]-[date]`
- Example: `task-auth-improvement-2025-09-28`

### 2. Task Folder Structure
Create a folder with the following required files:

```
task-[name]/
├── TASK_DEFINITION.md     # Task goals, requirements, and acceptance criteria
├── STATUS.md              # Current status and progress tracking
├── CHANGELOG.md           # Chronological log of changes and decisions
├── NOTES.md               # Additional notes, investigations, and findings
└── [additional-files]/    # Any task-specific files or artifacts
```

### 3. File Maintenance Rules
- **Update Frequency**: Update status and changelog after each significant change
- **History Preservation**: NEVER modify historical entries - only append new information
- **Incremental Updates**: Document what happened, not what you plan to do

### 4. Memory Bank System
Save important findings to `memory-bank/` folder for:
- **Repository Knowledge**: Architecture decisions, patterns, best practices
- **Development Insights**: Solutions to common problems, debugging techniques
- **Investigation Results**: Research findings, performance analysis, security considerations
- **General Development**: Reusable code snippets, configuration templates

### 5. Documentation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive titles and headers
- Include timestamps for all entries
- Reference related files, commits, or issues
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Tag entries with relevant categories (e.g., [SECURITY], [PERFORMANCE], [BUG-FIX])

### 6. Completion Process
- Update final status in STATUS.md
- Summarize key learnings in memory-bank if applicable
- Archive task folder or move to completed tasks directory
- Document any follow-up tasks or technical debt
